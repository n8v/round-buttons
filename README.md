round-buttons
=============

A client-side web app for making printable buttons for old school round pin-on name badges.


## TODO
- make the logo smaller/better - halftone at 600dpi maybe? 300dpi?  no, try like 72dpi blurry, it'll be OK. Add a gradient around the edge? Make it 


### MAYBE NEXT YEAR
- file upload for artwork
- controls to tweak artwork position
